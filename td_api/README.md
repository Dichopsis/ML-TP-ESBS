# Scoreboard API Deployment

I've built this API using FastAPI and I've deployed it on [https://deta.space/](https://deta.space/) for FREE !  
**The API URL is [https://td_api-1-z7311418.deta.app/](https://td_api-1-z7311418.deta.app/) with SWAGGER doc at [https://td_api-1-z7311418.deta.app/docs](https://td_api-1-z7311418.deta.app/)
Hopefully it should be running at all time, else you can contact me directly at lambdascience@tutanota.com !**

If you **really** want to build the API yourself using DETA (but you will loose quite a lot of time) you can:

- Create an account on https://deta.space/
- Install the release of the API: https://deta.space/discovery/r/qckm2rrhpl7zgpkj
- Go back to your space canvas (home) and click on TP_API card and copy the API link. Just replace it in the practical (the part that makes the requestion at the end show_leaderboard`and`send_my_score`)

  You can visit <your_url>/docs to get the Swagger info of your API.  
  Don't forget to change the URL in the Notebook in `show_leaderboard` and `send_my_score` function with your own API url.

Enjoy :)
